print "Mary had a little lamb." # prints the string
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow' # prints next line with 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went." # another line from the rhyme
print "." * 10 # prints 10 periods in a row

# now a bunch of variables to spell a word or two
end1 = "C"

print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, #prints the letters with a space instead of a newline
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 #and then the next word
